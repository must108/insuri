            What to Do After a Car Accident: Simple Steps
        </h2>
        <p>
            1. Stay Calm and Check for Injuries <br />
            -Take a moment to breathe.<br />
            -Check yourself and others for any injuries carefully.<br />
            -If anyone is hurt, call 911 right away.<br />
            2. Move to Safety<br />
            -If your car is drivable, move it to the side of the road.<br />
            -Turn on your hazard lights to alert other drivers.<br />
            -If you can’t move the car, and you are in a relatively safe zone stay inside with your seatbelt on. If not, exit the car. <br />
            3. Call for Help<br />
            -Call 911 to report the accident, even if it's minor.<br />
            -File a report with the police, which is useful for insurance.<br />
            4. Exchange Info <br />
            -Get the other driver’s information:<br />
                -Name<br />
                -Phone number<br />
                -Insurance info<br />
            -If there are witnesses, ask for their contact info.<br />
            5. Take Photos<br />
                -Use your phone to snap pictures of the car plates, any damage to the cars, and the surrounding area.<br />
                -If there are witnesses, ask for their contact info.<br />
            6. Don’t Admit Fault<br />
            -Be polite, but avoid saying things like “I’m sorry” that could be taken as admitting fault.<br />
            7. Call Your Insurance<br />
            -Report the accident to your insurance company as soon as you can.<br />
            8. Get Medical Attention<br />
            -Even if you feel fine, get checked out by a doctor. Some injuries might not show up right away.<br />
            9. Keep Records<br />
            -Save everything related to the accident: police reports, medical bills, repair estimates, etc.<br />
            10. Consider Legal Help<br />
            -If there are any disputes or serious injuries, think about talking to a lawyer to protect yourself.<br />
